// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If x%2==0, Print Even
Else x%2==1, Print Odd
End If

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(1, 24, 329, 40, 508)

Read N1, N2, N3, N4, N5
Avg(N1, N2, N3, N4, N5)
Write Avg

Set "maxvalue" as N1
For each remaining value
	If the value is greater than "maxvalue", then set value as "maxvalue"
Print "maxvalue"

Set "minvalue" as N1
For each remaining value
	If the value is less than "minvalue", then set value as "minvalue"
Print "minvalue"


The average of all 5 numbers is 180.4. 
The maxvalue is 508
the minvalue s 1
